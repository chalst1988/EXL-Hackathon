Bot true said: Modern insurance can be traced back to the city’s Great Fire of London, which occurred in 1666. After it destroyed more than 30,000 homes, a man named, Nicholas Barbon started a building insurance business. He later introduced the city’s first fire insurance company.

Bot true said: According to the study books of The Chartered Insurance Institute, there are variant methods of insurance as follows: Co-insurance – risks shared between insurers Dual insurance – having two or more policies with overlapping coverage of a risk (both the individual policies would not pay separately – under a concept named contribution, they would contribute together to make up the policyholder’s losses. However, in case of contingency insurances such as life insurance, dual payment is allowed) Self-insurance – situations where risk is not transferred to insurance companies and solely retained by the entities or individuals themselves Reinsurance – situations when the insurer passes some part of or all risks to another Insurer, called the reinsurer
